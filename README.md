# Review-Scrapper
This Project is intended to create a web scraper. Web scrappers are extensively used in the industry today for competitive pricing, market studies, customer sentiment analysis, etc. In this case, a review scrapper is used for extracting reviews from an e-commerce website and then deploying it to the Heroku cloud platform. This project takes a simple example of an online cell phone purchase and tries to create a review scrapper.
